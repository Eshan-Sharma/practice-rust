# Repository Description:

**Rust Journey: Building in Public**

This repository is a collection of all my Rust practice code, projects, and experiments. I'm using it to document my learning process, share my progress, and demonstrate my evolution as I explore and master Rust. By building in public, I hope to contribute to the community, receive feedback, and inspire others to embark on their own Rust journeys. Check out the commits to see how my skills have grown over time!
